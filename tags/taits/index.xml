A bug was reported to the compiler that involves type checking, inference, traits and in particular type alias impl traits (TAIT) with multiple defining uses and some other particular things about them. In this post we are going to explain how the system works as I was investigating this myself in order to fix this issue, what is the issue exactly about and then describe how we&amp;rsquo;ve solved the issue.</description></item></channel></rss>
